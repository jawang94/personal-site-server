This is the MongoDB server for my personal portfolio website's AMA (Ask Me Anything) screen.

I usually use GraphQL & PostgreSQL for my backends nowadays. I love the powerful and flexible structure that this combo provides.

This time around, I wanted to refresh my NoSQL/MongoDB skills so here we have a more "old school" MongoDB REST API. 

**Future Plans:**
- [ ] Admin pinned threads
- [ ] User favorited threads
- [ ] Support for full text search
